SMELT is a library that will extract the truth from social media screenshots. The library will use OCR against media to provide metadata for developers. The metadata will help developers make estimations on the legitimacy of the media.

## Reasoning
It is widely known that social media manipulation is a problem. There are tools to "fact check" posts, but those tools are not enough. Posts that contain fake social media screenshots are light-hearted, however, some people cannot tell fake from reality. Even when the fakes are obvious, there needs be a notice for manipulation. This library is my attempt to fix a global issue without changing too much.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for how this library is used. Nor am I promising features or updates. If you feel you can do better, please fork this repo and continue my goals.

## Goals
I hope to provide a Python library that is built on a modular design. I want to make it as easy as possible to determine the legitimacy of screenshots and other media. Hopefully, I can provide more functionality in the future such as a web API or other detection methods.

## Donations
I do not want to sell this product. I believe every one should have the right to determine truth from reality. That being said, I work a full time job and have other projects that I maintain. Donating to this project will inspire me to improve this project and our online world.
