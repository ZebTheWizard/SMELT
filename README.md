This library will use OCR against social media screenshots to provide metadata for developers. The metadata will help developers determine the legitimacy of social media.

##Reasoning
Since the 2016 election, it is widely known that social media manipulation is a problem. There are tools to "fact check" posts, but those tools are not enough. Posts that contain fake social media screenshots are light-hearted, however, some people cannot tell fake from reality. Even when the fakes are obvious, there needs be a notice for manipulation. This library is my attempt to fix a global issue without changing too much.

##Disclaimer
I am not responsible for how this library is used. Nor am I promising features or updates. If you feel you can do better, please fork this repo and continue my goals.

##Goals
I hope to provide a Python library that is built on a modular design. I want to make it as easy as possible to determine the legitimacy of screenshots and other media. Hopefully, I can provide more functionality in the future such as a web API or other detection methods.

##Donations
I do not want to sell this product. I believe every one should have the right to determine truth from reality. That being said, I work a full time job and have other projects that I maintain. Donating to this project will inspire me to improve this project and our online world.
